🚗 API Functionality Assessment

Technologies: REST API | Swagger 3.4.0 | AWS S3 | SQL

A validation and testing project focused on ensuring reliable API performance for connected vehicle systems. The work involved designing, executing, and validating RESTful API workflows to support key telematics features across Honda and Acura vehicles.

⭐ Key Contributions

Conducted end-to-end API validation using Swagger 3.4.0 for features such as connection time, provisioning, privacy protocol, remote tracking, and geo-fencing.

Updated and executed XML/JSON payloads to trigger API calls, verifying accurate request/response handling.

Performed data integrity checks using SQL and DBViewer to ensure consistency between front-end responses and back-end systems.

Monitored CAN, Ethernet, and diagnostic (Diag) data from DAQ systems to confirm correct functionality across multiple models.

Maintained organized test assets, logs, and regression data in AWS S3, ensuring full traceability for future validation cycles.

💡 Summary

This project demonstrates my ability to bridge software validation, data analysis, and system integration within an automotive context — emphasizing precision, reliability, and cross-functional collaboration.
